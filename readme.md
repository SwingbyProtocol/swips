# Swingby Protocol Specifications & White Papers

<img src="./hero.png" width="75%" />
<hr />

This repository contains specifications and improvement proposals for the various Swingby protocols, products and roadmap.

At its core Swingby is a set of open protocols driven by feedback from its underlying community. The company that funds development (Swingby Labs Pte. Ltd.) has created a blueprint that it believes represents the _optimal critical path_ to achieving the project's goals of implementing the fastest and widest-supported cross-chain bridges for DeFi, but it's important that the project leverages external input to make this happen.

Therefore, the purpose of this repository is to maintain transparency about the designs and development plans for the protocols and create an environment that is conducive to community involvement.

Here's what you'll find in this repository:
