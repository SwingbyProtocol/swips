# [⏎](./readme.md) SWIP-001: On-Chain Data & Addresses

# Summary
Definition of Skybridge Swap flows and Address use structure. 
Skybridge uses a single custody bridge model for 2 way-pegging.
This SWIP defines the address structure and requirements of Skybridge-v1.

# Motivation
As mentioned above, in designing Skybridge-v1, we built one custody address on each chain.
Each address is generated by TSS, and its private key is distributed and held by an unspecified number of Swing by Nodes. Such a model is very simple and will also be designed without the need for smart contracts

# Status
This SWIP is a work in progress.

# Specification
Requirements of the Skybrige-v1 addresses.
* One Source custody address (BTC) (controlled by TSS group)
* One Destination custody address (BNB) (controlled by TSS group)
* Staking (swingby tokens) staking address (controlled by peer owners)
* The “rewards” address to collect fee distributions, specified in the Staking Transaction. (controlled by peer owners)
