# [‚èé](./readme.md) SWIP-014: Additional Security Measures

# Summary

The idea of Another security measure (limit on the number of token that can be exported in a given time period)

# Motivation

Another optional security measure (one that is used by BancorX bridge for instance) is a limit on the number of tokens that can be exported in a given time period. Such a measure seems to have little negative implications, however, it drastically mitigates the potential damage in a worst-case scenario of a total bridge security breakdown.
